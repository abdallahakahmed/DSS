<h1>Decentralized Subscription Service</h1>

<p>This contract provides a decentralized solution for managing and processing subscription payments through cryptocurrency, targeting businesses or systems that want to offer subscription-based services without relying on traditional payment providers.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>Subscription Service Contract</strong> enables content creators, service providers, or platforms to offer subscription plans (monthly or yearly) directly on the blockchain. Users can select a subscription plan, make payments, and manage renewals independently, creating a more transparent and self-managed subscription process. This service could integrate as a third-party subscription tool within various systems, particularly those that want to leverage blockchain for financial transactions.</p>

<h2>Key Features and Benefits</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Automated Subscription Management</strong><br>
        Users can subscribe to a service with a monthly or yearly option. Payment amounts are fixed, and the contract handles the management of subscription status, renewal, and payment records. The system automatically updates subscription status when payments are received, eliminating manual checks.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Transparent Payment Processing</strong><br>
        Payments are made directly to a designated receiver address, providing transparency in where funds are directed. Each payment updates the subscription status, and users can check their subscription details at any time.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Error Handling and Robust Security</strong><br>
        To ensure smooth operations, the contract has robust error handling:
        <ul>
            <li>Unauthorized actions, incorrect payment amounts, or unregistered users trigger specific errors.</li>
            <li>Modifiers enforce permissions for owner-only actions and ensure users adhere to plan requirements.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Auto-Renewal Option</strong><br>
        Users can enable an auto-renewal feature to renew their subscription automatically if the previous subscription expires, provided they have sufficient funds. This feature is designed for uninterrupted service and allows users to maintain their subscription status easily.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Comprehensive Subscription Status Tracking</strong><br>
        The contract includes an accessible subscription history, allowing users to view their status, plan duration, start and end dates, and renewal settings. This visibility provides peace of mind to users and enables administrators to manage and verify subscriber status efficiently.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Withdrawals for Service Providers</strong><br>
        The contract owner can withdraw funds from the contract, ensuring collected subscription payments are accessible. The contract also includes error handling to prevent unauthorized or accidental withdrawals.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Decentralized Benefits</strong><br>
        By operating directly on the blockchain, the subscription process is secure, trustless, and decentralized, making it resilient against censorship and offering broader accessibility.
